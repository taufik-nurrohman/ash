Asynchronous Syntax Highlighter (~4 KB Minified)
================================================

> A hard mode client-side syntax highlighter for the web.

Ash aims to solve the problem of client-side syntax highlighter file size which usually gets bigger as you have more syntax variants that you need to highlight. With Ash, you will only need to load the main file once, and the associated language files will be loaded automatically as needed.
